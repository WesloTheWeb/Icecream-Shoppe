# ABOUT
This is a small project that is ice cream shop theme. 

## WHY?
It has been quite some time since I have coded in regular vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While I have not
forgotten it in the lands of frameworks, it's important to not rely heavily on frameworks. 

## Goals
I hope this site to evolve in time to create things listed below in features. I just want a snapshot in time of a
responsive, semantic, HTML site and that uses good naming conventions and functions of vanilla JavaScript. As for
the CSS it will be native, no framework needed. But I refuse to use BEM. MAYBE one day I'll adapt this to tailwind
or perhaps do a tailwind CSS project focus.

I also hope that making this public, people, friends and strangers I come across that are new to front end can use this
as a reference for DOM manipulation and semantic HTML (no div soups!!)

### Features
While a long way and this is something I will do in my spare time as I prep for interviews would be:

- responsive design with appropriate breakpoints and media queries
- âœ” <s>Body that has semantic HTML.</s>
- basic click events JavaSCript.
- built in Carousel.
- modern look.
- simple API integration, maybe a calendar of sort. Nothing too complicated.
    - Since this is a fictional shop, maybe a timer to show when it is open / closed on holidays in dynamic way?
