# ABOUT
This is a small project that is ice cream shop theme. 

## HOW TO RUN PROJECT LOCALLY:
1. Git clone this repository to your files.
2. (Preferred) You can get a Live Server if you are using Visual Studio Code. Once downloaded right-click 'index.html' and launch the server to view the page.

Or once downloaded, just click the index.html file in the downloaded folder as everything is contained in the folder.  


## WHY?
It has been quite some time since I have coded in regular vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While I have not
forgotten it in the lands of frameworks, it's important to not rely heavily on frameworks. 

## Goals
I hope this site to evolve in time to create things listed below in features. I just want a snapshot in time of a
responsive, semantic, HTML site and that uses good naming conventions and functions of vanilla JavaScript. <s>As for
the CSS I figure this is a perfect environment and playground to get used to tailwind CSS. I am confident in my natural CSS
abilities, and since it is just styling I figure this will be a good time to use it.</s> Tailwind is very time-consuming
and is just writing inline CSS with more steps. I will be writing my own, keeping it vanilla.

I also hope that making this public, people, friends and strangers I come across that are new to front end can use this
as a reference for DOM manipulation and semantic HTML (no div soups!!)

### Features
While a long way and this is something I will do in my spare time as I prep for interviews would be:

- responsive design with appropriate breakpoints and media queries
- ✔ <s>Body that has semantic HTML.</s>
- ✔ <s>basic click events JavaScript.</s>
- ✔ <s>build a Carousel.</s>
- ✔ <s>modern look.</s>

### Technology Stack used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES 6+) aka vanilla JS
- ChatGPT for content and filler text
- Pexel imagery for imagery

### Future Content
As fun as this was to do in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript I must get back to my current studies. I will gradually add more to this when I figure out how I want to do this site as I am mainly freestyling. I do hope this accomplishes two things: 
1. That I can do projects in vanilla and I do not rely heavily on frameworks, that this shows mastery of DOM manipulation.
2. It can help newcomers for a stimple static site. 


Some things to look forward to in the future:
- simple API integration, maybe a calendar of sort. Nothing too complicated.
    - Since this is a fictional shop, maybe a timer to show when it is open / closed on holidays in dynamic way?
- Menu Items 
    - Once I think of something clever
- Ice Cream builder
    - This is just heavy CSS and would be desktop only. Mostly CSS art.
